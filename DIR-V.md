### [Benchmarking principles](https://dberleant.github.io/papers/BenchmarkingContemporaryDeepLearningHardwareAndFrameworks.pdf)
- Relevance: Benchmarks should measure relatively vital features
- Representativeness: Benchmark performance metrics should be broadly accepted by industry and academia.
- Equity: All systems should be fairly compared.
- Cost-effectiveness: Benchmark tests are economical.
- Scalability: Benchmark tests should work across systems possessing a range of resources from low to high.
- Transparency: Benchmark metrics should be easy to understand.
### Types of Benchmarks
- Real Program
- Component Benchmark Microbenchmark
- Synthetic Benchmark
	- Whetstone
	- Dhrystone
	- These were the first general purpose industry standard computer benchmarks. They do not necessarily obtain high scores on modern pipelined computers.
- Parallel Benchmark
	- used on machines with multiple cores and/or processors, or systems consisting of multiple machines


### Introduction
In computing, a benchmark is the act of running a computer program, a set of programs, or other operations, in order to assess the relative performance of an object, normally by running a number of standard tests and trials against it.
### Performance 

The _performance_ or _speed_ of a processor depends on, among many other factors, the clock rate (generally given in multiples of [hertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz "Hertz")) and the instructions per clock (IPC), which together are the factors for the [instructions per second](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_second "Instructions per second") (IPS) that the CPU can perform.

The performance of the [memory hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy "Memory hierarchy") also greatly affects processor performance, an issue barely considered in IPS calculations.

Because of these problems, various standardized tests, often called ["benchmarks"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing) "Benchmark (computing)") for this purpose‚Äç
